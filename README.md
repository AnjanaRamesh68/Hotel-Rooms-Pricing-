# Hotel-Rooms-Pricing-

This project creates an excel pricing model to see the profit percentage for hotel rooms.
We provide the input parameters: Room Rent and Add on prices.
The model calculates the occupancy rate, all the expenses for the two days and  tax and provides the profit percentage.
This  helps the hotel owners to arrive at an optimial price for their rooms to achieve their desired profit percentage.
